    "doc_text.text": " Study Design The study was approved by Health Canada and ethics review boards at each of the 3 provincial centers.An external advisory panel and data and safety monitoring board were created by the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research to oversee the study conduct and participant safety.Cervical HPV detection and genotyping assays were conducted by the Provincial Health Services Authority Laboratory.This was a phase 3, postlicensure, age - stratified, noninferiority immunogenicity study conducted at 3 provincial centers in Canada with 3 parallel groups in 2 age groups receiving open - label quadrivalent HPV vaccine.Enrollment was conducted from August 1, 2007, through February 29, 2008, and was limited to healthy participants 9 through 13 years of age(girls) or 16 through 26 years of age(young women), with 4 or fewer lifetime sexual partners.Study exclusions were pregnancy at enrollment or at vaccine visit, history of genital warts or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or prior receipt of any HPV vaccine.Presence of HPV - 16, HPV - 18, HPV - 6, and HPV - 11 antibodies(all participants) or virus infection(among sexually active women participants) at study enrollment was an exclusion criterion from per - protocol study participant analysis for that genotype - specific outcome.At study entry girls were randomized(1: 1) in balanced, stratified blocks of 6 to receive either 2 doses(at 0 and 6 months) or 3 doses(at 0, 2, and 6 months).7 The coordinating center used SAS, version 9.2(SAS Institute Inc) to generate randomization lists for each site.Each site was treated as a stratum.Women were not randomized and received the standard 0 - , 2 - , and 6 - month vaccine schedule(FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2).Immunogenicity was assessed at 7 months(1 month after the last dose).Participants were eligible for follow - up blood samples to 36 months if they completed all immunizations and met criteria for subsequent blood sampling.All eligible participants provided a blood sample at 24 months after the first dose.To enhance study retention, participants within each cohort were randomized(1: 1) into blocks of 6 for a blood sample to be taken either at 18 or 36 months after the first dose.Participants received no compensation. Study Procedures Participants were recruited by advertising in newspapers, at local colleges, and by approved established recruitment procedures at each site.Consent for girls required written consent from parents or a legal guardian and written assent of study participants, and women followed the appropriate consent procedures for each province.Participants provided written consent a second time for blood samples drawn after 7 months.We purchased the licensed, commercially available quadrivalent vaccine, 2 which was administered using prefilled syringes with 25 - gauge, 2.54 - cm needles, into the deltoid muscle.Serum samples were taken from all participants at months 0, 7, and 24, and an additional serum sample was taken at either month 18 or 36. Health assessment, including sexual history, was obtained at study entry.Self - identified ethnicity was used to establish demographic similarities between groups.Vaccine was administered at 0, 2, and 6 months to girls and women receiving 3 doses, and at 0 and 6 months to girls receiving 2 doses.Sexually active women provided a vaginal swab at study entry for HPV detection and genotyping.Because this was a postlicensure study, data were only collected on serious adverse events occurring within 30 days of each vaccination.This information was collected at the next visit or if the participant called with concerns. Laboratory Analysis For HPV detection and genotyping, vaginal swabs were placed into specimen transport media, stored frozen, and transported to the Provincial Health Services Authority Laboratory.Vaginal swabs were screened for the presence of 37 HPV genotypes, including the 13 high - risk genotypes, using a commercial reverse line - blot assay.Merck Laboratory staff, blinded to group assignment, conducted the HPV IMMUNOGENICITY OF HPV VACCINE IN GIRLS VS WOMENantibody assays using a competitive Luminex immunoassay to detect HPV16, HPV - 18, HPV - 6, and HPV - 11 antibodies.The immunoassay measures genotype - specific neutralizing antibodies in human serum, which displace labeled detection monoclonal antibodies targeting neutralizing epitopes of the respective HPV types.Serostatus cutoff values were those determined in validation studies for use in both patients who were previously infected and those vaccinated(ie, 񮽙20 milli - Merck units per mL[mMU / mL] for HPV - 16, 񮽙24 mMU / mL for HPV - 18, 񮽙20 mMU / mL for HPV - 6, and񮽙 16 mMU / mL for HPV - 11).8, 9 Statistical Analysis The primary objective of this study was to determine whether geometric mean titer(GMT) antibody levels at 7 months(1 month after the last dose) among girls receiving 2 doses was noninferior to GMT antibody levels among young women receiving 3 doses for HPV - 16 and HPV - 18. Secondary objectives included comparisons of GMT antibody levels and seropositivity between girls receiving 2 doses and young women receiving 3 doses for HPV - 6 and HPV - 11, and between girls receiving 2 doses vs 3 doses for HPV - 16, HPV - 18, HPV - 6, and HPV - 11 at month 7. An important secondary objective was to examine durability of antibody response at 18, 24, and 36 months after the first dose by examining seropositivity and GMTs in the 3 study groups for antibodies to the 4 vaccine antigens.Sample size was calculated using a 1 - sided񮽙 equals .025 of noninferiority among the young women group and the 2 treatment groups, equal allocation in the 3 groups, with a power of 99 % .10 An estimate of assay variance was inferred from the published immunogenicity trial data.2, 11 The clinically relevant difference in GMT was computed as the exponential of the difference of the mean of 2 groups in the log scale.A P value of .05 was implicitly used to declare statistical significance, but the focus was on 95 % CIs for the between - group comparisons.CriIMMUNOGENICITY OF HPV VACCINE IN GIRLS VS WOMEN teria for declaring noninferiority of a treatment group were defined as the lower bounds of the multiplicityadjusted 95 % CI for a GMT ratio(girls or women) greater than 0.5.This noninferiority margin was based on benchmarks set by Merck for other bridging studies leading to licensure, according to regulatory guidance.2 - 4, 12 We needed 235 evaluable participants per group for a total of 705 participants.Sample size was further inflated by 10 % in the girls cohort and 30 % in the women cohort to allow for loss to follow - up and higher baseline HPV antibody positivity in the women for an anticipated recruitment of 825 participants. Analyses Population The primary interest was in the perprotocol population;however, the results presented are the intention - totreat population because these results can be more readily generalizable.The per - protocol population included individuals who were seronegative(all participants) and had a negative result for a HPV genotype at enrollment(assessed in women only), received all assigned doses of the vaccine, and adhered to all study procedures.Participants who did not follow protocol and / or were seropositive or polymerase chain reaction− positive for HPV - 16, HPV18, HPV - 6, or HPV - 11 at enrollment were excluded from the per - protocol population analysis but retained for the intention - to - treat population analysis.Participants were eligible to continue with the 18 - and 36 - month follow - up if they had all of their doses of vaccine and a 7 - month blood sample collected.If participants were excluded from the per - protocol population analysis at 7 months, they remained excluded for the remainder of the study but were retained for intention - to - treat analysis.Geometric mean titer ratios and corresponding 95 % CIs were calculated using general linear models(SAS, version 9.2).The main intention - to - treat analysis was performed excluding missing values, but a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation to generate values for missing data was done for results at 7 months.Seroconversion rates and 95 % CIs among groups were calculated using the Wilson risk sum score method.10 RESULTS A total of 830 participants were enrolled from August 2007 through February 2008 with 767 participants(92.4 % ) evaluable for the per - protocol population analysis at month 7(Figure 1 andFigure 2).Missing baseline blood samples and participant withdrawal of consent were the most frequent reasons for exclusion from the perprotocol population analysis.For months 18, 24, and 36, 675 participants were evaluable for the intention - to - treat population analysis.Characteristics of study participants in the intention - to - treat population are presented inTABLE 1. Within each enrollment site girls receiving 2 or 3 doses were balanced for demographics(eAppendix 1, available at http: //www.jama.com). The aggregated data for both girls groups were comparable regarding age, weight, body mass index, and ethnicity, whereas the women receiving 3 doses were older (mean age, 19 years), had higher weight, and were more ethnically diverse (11% nonwhite). Scheduled vaccine doses were received by 98.6% of study participants with no serious adverse events reported. Results were consistent between the intention-to-treat (Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; HPV, human papillomavirus. a Blank cells reflect an absence of data.Table 3). For the primary outcome, at 7 months, all but 2 participants (񮽙99%) seroconverted; 1 from the girls group receiving 2 doses and 1 from the women group receiving 3 doses did not seroconvert to HPV-6. The GMT antibody levels in girls receiving 2 doses wereantibody levels for all 4 vaccine genotypes declined between months 7 and 18 to a plateau level that was maintained out to 36 months. Both girls groups continued to maintain higher plateau levels of antibody at 36 months than women. When comparing girls receiving 2 doses with girls receiving 3 doses, evidence for noninferiority was lost for HPV-18 by month 24 and for HPV-6 by month 36 (Table 2). IMMUNOGENICITY OF HPV VACCINE IN GIRLS VS WOMEN DISCUSSION Although effective and safe HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer are available, several key questions remain unanswered before global implementation of vaccine programs occur.In particular, more information is needed on the immunogenicity and efficacy of reduced - dose schedules, and the duration of immune responses after completion of a full or reduced - dose series.We have established that the immunogenicity of a 2 - dose schedule at 0 and 6 months in girls 9 through 13 years of age is statistically noninferior for HPV - 16 and HPV - 18 to the immunogenicity in women receiving 3 doses, assessed 1 month after the final dose.The GMTs in girls receiving a 2 - dose schedule were between 1.77 - to 2.24 - fold higher than those in women receiving a 3 - dose schedule, assessed 1 month after the final dose, which is consistent with the bridging studies that led to the licensing of the 3 - dose vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years of age.We have determined that the majority of girls receiving 2 doses seroconvert by month 7, and although they decline, GMTs plateau at month 18, and remain detectable to month 36 and noninferior to women for the same time frame.These are the first data, to our knowledge, on the duration of the immune response of young adolescent girls to a reduceddose schedule of quadrivalent HPV vaccine out to 3 years.These data will help to inform public health program planning.Licensure of quadrivalent HPV vaccine for preadolescent and adolescent girls was based on immunogenicitybridging studies that established better immune responses in girls than in women who participated in the efficacy trials.3 Bridging studies were required because there is no available correlate of protection, and efficacy studies requiring cervical cancer screening in young girls are not feasible.The setting of the noninferior criterion relies on regulatory guidance and opinions about what is a clinically meaningful difference.The lower confidence bound of the 95 % CI for the GMT ratios, girls receiving 2 doses and women receiving 3 doses of greater than 0.5 for all HPV types, is consistent with other prelicensure trials of quadrivalent HPV 2 - 4 vaccine and with other vaccines for which no correlate of protection was identified.13 Our study shows that the noninferior immune response previously found in girls receiving 3 doses 3 compared with women is also present with 2 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine given at 0 and 6 months.A study of a 2 - dose schedule using the bivalent HPV vaccine showed noninferiority of immune responses in girls up to 24 months compared with women aged 15 to 25 years receiving 3 doses.14 The antibody responses of aThe number of doses and cost of HPV vaccines are barriers to global implementation, in both developed and developing nations.Reducing the number of doses affects vaccine and administration costs as well as potentially improving uptake rates.26, 27 Evidence - based decision making in public health has led to reduced - dose schedules for hepatitis B, pneumococcal, and meningococcal serogroup C vaccine programs.28 - 30 There is a balance to be found between the incremental value of an additional dose on population effectiveness and the opportunity costs of using the resources required for the extra dose in other public health programs.This is especially the case for HPV vaccines at their present cost. Summary of Month 7, 18, 24, and 36 Anti– Human Papillomavirus Competitive Immunoassay Geometric Mean Titers in the Per - Protocol Population Children learn at their own pace, and it is a mistake to try to force them.The great incentive to effort, all through life, is experience of success after initial difficulties.The difficulties must not be so great as to cause discouragement, or so small as not to stimulate effort.From birth to death, this is a fundamental principle.It is by what we do ourselves that we learn.
